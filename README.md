## pokeRoulette
PokeDex is a web application that shows a roulette line of 7 pokemon and spins until it lands on one.

## Usage
To play the game simply click the "Generate" button and it starts the roulette until it lands onto a Pokemon. The chances of getting a shiny 0.01% and the chances of getting a legendary is 0.01%. I will update this to show every pokemon won on the users end.
